# Problem Statement
Unlocking Untapped Potential: Australia's startup ecosystem is full with promising early-stage founders, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds or outside traditional networks, who often remain undiscovered by investors, mentors, and strategic partners. This lack of visibility leads to missed opportunities for growth, limits the diversity of funded ventures, and ultimately slows the overall innovation landscape in Australia. 

Existing discovery methods are often inefficient, relying heavily on personal networks or broad, uncurated databases, making it difficult to pinpoint talent with precision and gain comprehensive insights into their potential. 

# How do we solve this? 
Nextwave is an intelligent discovery platform for Australian founders. We are leveraging comprehensive, data-driven founder profiles and advanced filtering capabilities to create a centralized, accessible resource for investors, mentors, and corporates. 
Our solution provides: 

1. Precision Discovery: Enabling users to quickly identify founders based on specific criteria like experience, location, and unique "founder archetypes," cutting through the noise to find truly relevant opportunities.
2. Dynamic Data Sources: Data that speaks volumes; upto 4000+ profiles extracted by leveraging LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Techboard, and more to find non-obvious talent.
3. Diversity at the Forefront: Championing founders of all backgrounds, driving a more inclusive Australian startup ecosystem.
4. In-depth Insights: Offering rich, validated founder profiles that go beyond surface-level information, providing a holistic view of their background, skills, funding experience, and current ventures.
